	/// <summary>
	/// The initial structure of this reader is based on code at https://github.com/aanon4/FlySkyIBus
	/// The original code depends on the gap between the frames to determine where a frame starts.
	/// I wanted to make a reader that is independent of inter-frame gap. This is achieved by keeping
	/// a buffer and trying to parse a valid frame starting at different offsets. Once a vlid frame
	/// is found, from then on, frames can be read one after another without checking for a
	/// gap. If for some reason the checksum is wrong for more than three frames we assume that we have
	/// lost sync and we start looking for the beginning of a valid frame anew.
	/// 
	/// IBUS protocol is very simple, but yet it is enough for most uses. It consists of frame with
	/// the following structure:
	/// * 1 byte            -> length of the frame including the length byte itself and checksum.
	/// * (length-3) bytes  -> data
	/// * 2 bytes           -> checksum. It is calculated by taking 0xffff and subtracting each frame byte
	/// 	                       from that. The checksum is stored with LSB first.
	/// 
	/// The 'data' part of the frame has the following format:
	/// * 1 byte           -> command. This determines the payload type - currently only command 0x40 is known
	/// 	                   for 'channel data'
	/// * remaining bytes  -> payload
	/// 	for the 0x40 command, the payload has the form of an array of 16bit integers - one integer
	/// 	for each channel. The integers are stored with LSB first
	/// 
	/// So the general form is:
	/// | frame length |               data                           |   checksum     |
	/// |    <len>     |   <cmd(0x40)> <ch1l><ch1h> <ch2l><ch2h> ...  |  <chkl><chkh>  |
	///
